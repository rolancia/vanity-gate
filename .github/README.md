*VanityGate* is the smart reverse-proxy that powers *[VanityTab](https://vanitytab.com  )*.

It exposes a single endpoint and, on demand, spins up — or seamlessly swaps — resource-heavy backend apps. (e.g., Whisper, Stable Diffusion)

so users can move between services with zero downtime and no manual orchestration.
